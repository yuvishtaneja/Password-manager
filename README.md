# Password Manager
This is a python code that can save your passwords for you. It saves three attributes: Website name, Email ID, and Password. It can also generate a strong password for you, which is automatically copied so you can directly paste it. In this code, it saves your password as a JSON file. You can also search your existing passwords by website name.

# How it works
It uses a python library to create an interface for all these features.

# How to use
You can start by downloading the zip file, and after extracting it, make sure you have two python libraries installed: tkinter and pyperclip. If you don't have these installed, it will not work on your computer.
